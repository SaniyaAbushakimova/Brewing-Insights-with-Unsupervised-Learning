## Project Description

In the world of beer, certain varieties stand out due to their versatile flavors, making them popular choices among consumers. A business owner aiming to meet popular demand needs to curate a simple yet appealing range of beers. However, given the overwhelming number of beer styles available, it is impractical to include every type in the inventory.

This project utilizes **clustering analysis** to assist the business owner in identifying a representative sample of beers. By examining various features of different beers (e.g. Astringency, Bitter, Alcohol etc), the analysis seeks to group them into distinct clusters, enabling the owner to select a diverse yet manageable assortment for their inventory.
